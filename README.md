Problem Description
Here we are drawing Football fixture (EPL Fixtures) using Genetic Algorithm. Genetic Algorithm is a method of solving optimisation problem inspired by natural selection where fittest  individual are selected for mating in order to produce healthy new generation. <br/>
Operators in Genetic Algorithm <br/>
Initial population <br/>
 Fitness function <br/>
 SelectionCrossover <br/>
Mutation <br/>
While scheduling following schedule Following criteria are being satisfied: <br/>
A team cannot play with itself <br/>
Each team plays exactly 2(I.e. number of rounds) matches against each team in the league <br/>
Each team plays [total number of matches – number of rounds] matches in the league <br/>
Each team plays exactly one match at its own home ground and one match at opponent’s home ground. (One – home, One - away) <br/>
Two matches cannot take place on the same day and same location <br/>
A team cannot play 2 matches on the same day <br/>
